Return to Sender Processing

Return to sender processing comes in a number of different flavours. 
It may be as simple as scanning a barcode from the returned document and returning the scanned barcodes back to our client.
It may also include scanning of the document and indexing some key fields from the document and returning an image of the document as well as the indexed metadata back to our client.

Invoice Processing

This typically will involve scanning the document or ingesting an inbound e-mail, classifying the document, indexing the document and returning the document along with the indexed metadata back to our client.

Classifying the document is typically determining if the document is an Invoice, Credit Note, Purchase Order or other piece of Correspondence.

Indexing the document is typically done via OCR techniques along with human intervention to key in or correct fields that the OCR was unable to achieve successfully. Index fields typically include Purchase Order Number, Invoice Number, Invoice Date, ABN, Invoice Total, Sub Total, GST and Line items associated with the invoice.
